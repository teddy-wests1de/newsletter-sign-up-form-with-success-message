## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge was a very good compliment of all the previous Challenges in one. I've learned to best way of adding and removing classes, especially when hiding an element is by chaining it to the main class in css and adding the hidden code. This will then enable you to write set display flex and grid properties easier on the main class of the element.



### Continued development

I would still need to Improve on Javascript Objects and Destructuring.
